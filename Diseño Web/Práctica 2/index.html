                <p>We started Arctic Monkeys in 2002 as a group of friends from Sheffield, playing in
                    garages and doing a few local gigs. It was just Alex (vocals, guitar), Jamie (guitar), Andy (bass),
                    and Matt (drums), having fun making music. Things really took off when people began sharing our
                    recordings online, especially on MySpace.</p>

                <p> By the time we released “I Bet You Look Good on the Dancefloor” in 2005, it went straight to number
                    one
                    in the UK. Our debut album, "Whatever People Say I Am, That's What I'm Not" (2006), became the
                    fastest-selling debut in UK history. It all happened naturally—through gigs and word-of-mouth,
                    without a
                    big campaign, just music that connected with people.</p>

            <p>We weren’t thinking about making a classic or changing music; we were just <strong>documenting the
                    nights
                    out </strong>, the streets we walked, and the characters we met. It’s fast, loud, and raw, just
                like the gigs
                we were playing in those early days. A lot of the songs were written about <strong>the chaos of
                    being out
                    late </strong>, getting into scrapes, and all the stuff that seemed important back then. It’s
                mad to think it
                resonated with so many people, but it was honest, and I guess people heard that. <strong>We had no
                    idea it’d
                    take off like it did. </strong> It’s all there, a snapshot of who we were at the time, before
                all the madness
                kicked off.</p>
