                <p>We <strong>started</strong> Arctic Monkeys in 2002 as a group of friends from Sheffield, playing in
                    garages and doing a few local gigs. It was just Alex (vocals, guitar), Jamie (guitar), Andy (bass),
                    and Matt (drums), having fun making music.<strong> Things really took off </strong> people began
                    sharing our
                    recordings online, especially on MySpace.</p>

                <p> By the time we released <i>“I Bet You Look Good on the Dancefloor”</i> in 2005, it went straight to
                    <strong> number
                        one
                        in the UK.</strong> Our debut album, <i>"Whatever People Say I Am, That's What I'm Not"</i>
                    (2006), became the
                    <strong> fastest-selling debut in UK </strong> history. It all happened naturally—through gigs and
                    word-of-mouth,
                    without a
                    big campaign, just music that connected with people.

                <h2>Whatever People Say I Am, That's What I'm Not</h2>
                <p>We weren’t thinking about making a classic or changing music; we were just <strong>documenting the
                        nights
                        out </strong>, the streets we walked, and the characters we met. It’s fast, loud, and raw, just
                    like the gigs
                    we were playing in those early days. A lot of the songs were written about <strong>the chaos of
                        being out
                        late </strong>, getting into scrapes, and all the stuff that seemed important back then. It’s
                    mad to think it
                    resonated with so many people, but it was honest, and I guess people heard that. <strong>We had no
                        idea it’d
                        take off like it did. </strong> It’s all there, a snapshot of who we were at the time, before
                    all the madness
                    kicked off.</p>

            <p> As Arctic Monkeys, after the success of our <strong> debut album </strong> in 2006, things kept moving
                fast.
                Andy Nicholson
                left the band that year, and Nick O'Malley took over on bass. We quickly followed up with our
                <strong>second album </strong>,
                <i>"Favourite Worst Nightmare"</i> (2007), which showed a more aggressive, <strong> polished sound
                </strong>.

        <div class="style-flex" id="end-new-style-flex">
            <p>In 2009, we released <i>"Humbug,"</i> a <strong>darker, heavier album</strong> produced by Josh Homme of
                Queens of the Stone Age. This was a turning point for us, experimenting with <strong>different sounds
                    and styles</strong>. Some people were surprised by the change, but it showed we weren’t afraid to
                evolve.</p>

                <p>By 2011, <i>"Suck It and See" </i> took us back to a lighter, <strong> more melodic sound
                    </strong>,
                    but it was our fifth album,
                    "AM" (2013), that really brought us <strong>global recognition </strong>. Songs like "Do
                    I Wanna
                    Know?" and "R U
                    Mine?" helped us break into the U.S. market,<strong> earning critical acclaim
                    </strong>and
                    commercial success
                    worldwide.</p>

                <p> We took a <strong>bit of a break </strong> after that, and it wasn’t until 2018 that we
                    dropped our
                    next album,
                    <i>"Tranquility Base Hotel & Casino"</i>. It was a big shift for us—a lot <strong>more
                        experimental
                        and slower, </strong>
                    with a spacey, lounge vibe. Some people were surprised by the change in direction, but
                    we wanted to
                    <strong> try something different </strong>. It wasn’t what everyone expected, but we
                    were proud of
                    it and felt it was
                    important to keep evolving.
