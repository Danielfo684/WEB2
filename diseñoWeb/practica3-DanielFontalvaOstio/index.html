            <h1>Climbing Walls</h1>
            <h2>Your Gateway to the Climbing World</h2>
            <p>Climbing walls are the perfect starting point for anyone interested in
                the sport of climbing. Designed to mimic real rock faces, these indoor walls offer a controlled
                environment where you can practice your skills, build strength, and develop technique. Whether you're
                into bouldering, lead climbing, or top-rope climbing, indoor climbing walls provide endless challenges
                and fun.</p>
            <div class="contentPage-subtitle">Types of Climbing Walls</div>
            <li class="contentPage-list">
                <ul>Bouldering Walls: Shorter walls (around 15 feet) without ropes, where you climb routes known as
                    "problems" over padded floors.</ul>
                <ul>Top-Rope Walls: Taller walls where you're securely harnessed to a rope anchored at the top, perfect
                    for beginners learning the basics.</ul>
                <ul>Lead Climbing Walls: Advanced climbers can practice clipping into quickdraws as they ascend,
                    offering a taste of outdoor sport climbing.</ul>

            <h2>Embrace the Adventure</h2>
            <p>Mountain climbing, or rock climbing in the great outdoors, is an exhilarating experience that connects
                you to nature in its most raw and powerful form. Unlike indoor climbing, outdoor climbing offers diverse
                terrains, unpredictable conditions, and breathtaking views, making it both a thrilling challenge and a
                deeply rewarding adventure.</p>

            <li class="contentPage-list">
                <ul>Sport Climbing: Climb routes bolted with permanent anchors, making it a popular style for climbers
                    seeking adventure with reliable protection.</ul>
                <ul>Traditional (Trad) Climbing: Climbers place their own protective gear into cracks as they ascend,
                    requiring a high level of skill and experience.</ul>
                <ul>Bouldering: Like indoor bouldering but on real rock, where you climb without ropes over shorter,
                    often more challenging routes.</ul>
